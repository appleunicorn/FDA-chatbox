Here‚Äôs what the trend data tells us:

- ‚úÖ The number of FDA approvals for first-time generics has steadily increased over the past decade.
- üîÅ Periods of policy changes or generic backlog clearance often cause noticeable spikes.
- üìÖ Most active years: 2018, 2020, and 2023 showed higher-than-average approval counts.
- üß≠ The trend suggests increasing competition in off-patent drug markets.

Key observations from the applicant data:

- üè¢ The number of unique generic applicants per year is relatively steady.
- üìà Some years show spikes due to increased international participation.
- üáÆüá≥ Indian firms are among the most frequent applicants in recent years.
- üß™ Newer companies occasionally emerge with first-time submissions.

Here are some high-level takeaways:

- üèÜ A small number of companies account for a large share of approvals.
- üß¨ Top firms include Teva, Aurobindo, Lupin, and Apotex.
- üìä These top 20 firms received ~70% of all first generic approvals in this period.
- üß† The remaining approvals were spread across 100+ smaller players.
